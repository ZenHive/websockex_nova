## Active Critical Financial Infrastructure Tasks

### WNX0019: HeartbeatManager Implementation ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETED - Integrated directly into Client GenServer  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: Large (required Client refactor)  
**Dependencies**: None

**Implementation Summary**: Following architectural analysis, heartbeat functionality was integrated directly into the Client GenServer rather than creating a separate HeartbeatManager process. This simpler approach provides better performance and maintains all benefits while reducing complexity.

**Platform-Specific Handling**: Created helper modules architecture for clean separation:
- `lib/websockex_new/helpers/deribit.ex` - Deribit-specific heartbeat handling
- Future: `helpers/binance.ex` for Binance ping/pong frames
- Client dispatches to helpers based on platform configuration

#### Target Implementation
**PRODUCTION-READY APPROACH**: Implement automatic heartbeat processing during the entire connection lifecycle, not just bootstrap. Financial trading connections require continuous, automatic heartbeat handling to prevent order cancellation due to connection monitoring failures.

#### Technical Requirements (CRITICAL - FINANCIAL TRADING)
**Heartbeat Sequence**: When heartbeats have been set up, the API server will send heartbeat messages and test_request messages. Your software should respond to test_request messages by sending a `/api/v2/public/test` request. If your software fails to do so, the API server will immediately close the connection. If your account is configured to cancel on disconnect, any orders opened over the connection will be cancelled.

**Production Risk**: A simple loop is insufficient for production financial trading. Heartbeat failures can cause immediate order cancellation, resulting in financial losses.

#### Architecture Issue Discovered
The HeartbeatManager GenServer cannot receive WebSocket messages because:
1. Gun sends messages to the process that opened the connection
2. Client is currently just a struct, not a process
3. No message routing exists to forward Gun messages to HeartbeatManager

This is a **critical blocker** - without message routing, heartbeat handling is impossible, leading to disconnections and order cancellations in financial trading.

**See**: [Gun Integration Guide](gun_integration.md) for detailed explanation of Gun's process ownership model and how it affects our architecture.

#### Recommended Solution: Client as GenServer
Convert Client from a struct-returning module to a GenServer that:
- Owns the Gun connection and receives all WebSocket messages
- Routes messages to appropriate handlers (HeartbeatManager, user callbacks)
- Maintains backward API compatibility
- Enables future message processing features
- **Coordinates reconnection** and re-establishes message routing after connection drops

#### Critical Coordination Requirement
The Client GenServer is essential for reconnection flow:
1. Client GenServer owns and monitors the Gun connection
2. On connection drop, Client triggers Reconnection module
3. Client receives new Gun process from reconnection
4. Client re-establishes message routing to HeartbeatManager
5. HeartbeatManager resumes heartbeat handling seamlessly

Without Client as a coordinating process, there's no way to properly handle the reconnection ‚Üí message routing flow, making this architecture change mandatory for production reliability.

#### File Structure
```
lib/websockex_new/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.ex               # Enhanced with automatic message processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heartbeat_handler.ex    # Dedicated heartbeat management process
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deribit_adapter.ex  # Enhanced integration with automatic heartbeat
```

#### Simplicity Progression Plan
1. **Start Simple**: Add dedicated heartbeat handler process
2. **Proven Pattern**: Use GenServer for reliable message processing (exception to no-GenServer rule for critical financial infrastructure)
3. **Add Complexity When Necessary**: This is a case where complexity is proven necessary by financial risk requirements

#### Abstraction Evaluation
**Concrete Use Cases** (‚â•3 required for abstraction):
1. Deribit test_request continuous processing
2. Deribit heartbeat during active trading sessions
3. Future platform heartbeat requirements (Binance, FTX, etc.)
4. Connection monitoring and automatic recovery

**Decision**: Create HeartbeatHandler abstraction - financial trading reliability requirements justify the complexity.

#### Production Requirements
- **Continuous Processing**: Heartbeats must be handled 24/7 during active connections
- **Sub-second Response**: test_request must be answered within API timeout (typically 1-5 seconds)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Heartbeat handler must restart on failure without losing connection
- **Monitoring**: Track heartbeat response times and failures for operational visibility
- **Graceful Degradation**: If heartbeat fails, connection should close cleanly to prevent phantom orders

#### Updated Architecture Decision (May 2025)
**CORE LIBRARY APPROACH**: After architectural review, heartbeat/ping-pong functionality will be implemented as a general-purpose feature in the core library with customizable handlers, rather than being Deribit-specific. This follows the WebSocket standard where ping/pong is fundamental protocol functionality used across many APIs.

#### Revised File Structure
```
lib/websockex_new/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.ex               # Enhanced with HeartbeatManager integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heartbeat_manager.ex    # General-purpose heartbeat/ping-pong infrastructure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deribit_adapter.ex  # Configures HeartbeatManager with Deribit-specific patterns
```

#### Core Library Justification
- **WebSocket Standard**: Ping/pong and heartbeat are fundamental WebSocket protocol features
- **Multi-Platform Need**: Binance, FTX, Kraken, and other exchanges require similar heartbeat handling
- **Platform Differences**: Each exchange uses different heartbeat patterns (Deribit: test_request, Binance: ping/pong, etc.)
- **Abstraction Value**: General HeartbeatManager can handle any platform's heartbeat pattern via configuration

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **HeartbeatManager**: Core library module handling continuous message processing
2. **Configurable Handlers**: Platform adapters configure heartbeat detection and response patterns
3. **DeribitAdapter Integration**: Configure HeartbeatManager with Deribit-specific test_request/public_test pattern
4. **Future Platform Support**: Other exchanges can easily configure their heartbeat patterns

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Client GenServer Refactor** ‚úÖ
- [x] **WNX0019a**: Convert Client module to GenServer while maintaining public API
- [x] **WNX0019b**: Move Gun connection ownership to Client process
- [x] **WNX0019c**: Implement message routing logic for different message types
- [x] **WNX0019d**: Ensure all existing tests pass with new architecture

**Phase 2: Heartbeat Integration** ‚úÖ
- [x] **WNX0019e**: Integrated heartbeat handling directly in Client GenServer
- [x] **WNX0019f**: Implemented Deribit test_request response and platform-specific patterns
- [x] **WNX0019g**: Added heartbeat tracking with MapSet and failure monitoring
- [x] **WNX0019h**: Created comprehensive tests with real Deribit API

**Phase 3: Production Hardening**
- [ ] **WNX0019i**: Add supervision strategies for Client GenServer
- [ ] **WNX0019j**: Implement graceful degradation on heartbeat failures
- [ ] **WNX0019k**: Conduct 24-hour stability test with continuous heartbeats
- [ ] **WNX0019l**: Document production deployment guidelines

#### ExUnit and Integration Test Requirements
- Real API test against test.deribit.com verifying continuous heartbeat response
- Long-running test (minimum 10 minutes) to verify heartbeat stability
- Test heartbeat handler recovery after process failure
- Test connection termination when heartbeat responses fail
- Performance test: verify heartbeat response time under load

#### Error Handling Patterns
- **Client GenServer crash**: Supervisor restarts Client, re-establishes connection
- **test_request timeout**: Close connection immediately to prevent order issues
- **Connection loss during heartbeat**: Client triggers reconnection automatically
- **Response send failure**: Log error, attempt retry once, then close connection

#### Implementation Notes
- Heartbeat handling integrated directly into Client GenServer for simplicity
- Platform-specific logic delegated to helper modules (e.g., helpers/deribit.ex)
- Use `Process.monitor/1` to detect Gun connection failures
- Heartbeat timer managed within Client state
- Add telemetry events for heartbeat monitoring and alerting

#### Complexity Assessment
- **Previous**: Client was a simple struct, no message processing capability
- **Current**: Client as GenServer with integrated heartbeat handling
- **Added Complexity**: ~200 lines (Client GenServer conversion + heartbeat integration)
- **Justification**: Fundamental architecture requirement - Gun needs a process to send messages to
- **Benefits**: Enables all async message processing features, not just heartbeats
- **Maintains**: All existing public API compatibility + adds critical infrastructure

### WNX0020: Request/Response Correlation Manager
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Small  
**Dependencies**: None

#### Target Implementation
Track and correlate WebSocket request/response pairs for reliable order management:
- Request ID tracking with configurable timeouts
- Response matching to original requests
- Timeout handling for pending requests
- Simple correlation table using ETS

#### Real Trading Risk
Without request correlation, you can't reliably know if orders succeeded or failed. This leads to:
- Duplicate orders from retries
- Ghost positions from unknown order status
- Inability to reconcile exchange state

#### File Structure
```
lib/websockex_new/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ request_tracker.ex      # Simple request/response correlation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client.ex               # Enhanced with correlation support
```

#### Simplicity Progression Plan
1. **Start Simple**: ETS table mapping request_id -> {request, timeout}
2. **Proven Pattern**: Return {:error, :timeout} after configurable delay
3. **Add When Needed**: Only add features based on real trading issues

#### Subtasks
- [ ] **WNX0020a**: Create request_tracker.ex with ETS-based correlation table
- [ ] **WNX0020b**: Add track_request/3 and match_response/2 functions
- [ ] **WNX0020c**: Implement timeout detection with Process.send_after
- [ ] **WNX0020d**: Integrate with Client.send_message for automatic tracking
- [ ] **WNX0020e**: Test with real Deribit order placement/cancellation

#### Implementation Notes
- ~50 lines total implementation
- Use ETS for O(1) lookup performance
- Leverage existing JSON-RPC ID field
- No complex abstractions, just simple mapping

### WNX0021: Basic Rate Limiter
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Small  
**Dependencies**: None

#### Target Implementation
Prevent API rate limit violations with simple token bucket:
- Configurable rate limits per connection
- Token bucket algorithm implementation
- Automatic request queueing when limit reached
- Simple, proven approach used across financial APIs

#### Real Trading Risk
Hitting rate limits causes:
- Temporary API bans (missed trading opportunities)
- Order rejections during critical moments
- Complete system lockout in worst case

#### File Structure
```
lib/websockex_new/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rate_limiter.ex         # Token bucket rate limiting
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client.ex               # Enhanced with rate limit checks
```

#### Simplicity Progression Plan
1. **Start Simple**: Basic token bucket with fixed refill rate
2. **Proven Pattern**: Standard algorithm used by exchanges
3. **Add When Needed**: Burst handling only if actually hitting limits

#### Subtasks
- [ ] **WNX0021a**: Create rate_limiter.ex with token bucket logic
- [ ] **WNX0021b**: Add consume_token/2 and refill logic
- [ ] **WNX0021c**: Integrate with Client.send_message
- [ ] **WNX0021d**: Add configurable limits to Config struct
- [ ] **WNX0021e**: Test against Deribit rate limits with burst traffic

#### Implementation Notes
- ~30 lines total implementation
- Use Process.send_after for token refill
- Queue requests when tokens exhausted
- Return {:error, :rate_limited} when queue full

### WNX0022: JSON-RPC 2.0 API Builder ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium (Nice to have)  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: None (made general-purpose)

#### Completed Implementation
Created a general-purpose JSON-RPC 2.0 API builder as a core module in WebsockexNew:
- ‚úÖ Created `lib/websockex_new/json_rpc.ex` as 8th core module
- ‚úÖ Implements `build_request/2` for JSON-RPC request generation
- ‚úÖ Implements `match_response/1` for response parsing
- ‚úÖ Created `defrpc` macro for API method generation
- ‚úÖ Updated Deribit adapter with 29 API methods using the macro
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ Configured `.formatter.exs` for parentheses-free macro syntax
- ‚úÖ Tested macro-generated methods with test.deribit.com API
- ‚úÖ Documented macro usage patterns for market making workflows

#### Design Philosophy
Originally planned as Deribit-specific, this was implemented as a general-purpose module following the principle of building reusable components. Any WebSocket API using JSON-RPC 2.0 can now leverage this functionality.

#### Core Features
```elixir
# Simple API method definition
use WebsockexNew.JsonRpc
defrpc :get_order_book, "public/get_order_book", doc: "Get order book"

# Generates a function that returns:
{:ok, %{
  "jsonrpc" => "2.0",
  "id" => <unique_id>,
  "method" => "public/get_order_book",
  "params" => params
}}
```

#### Deribit Integration
The Deribit adapter now includes 29 commonly used methods:
- **Authentication & Session**: auth, test, set_heartbeat, disable_heartbeat
- **Market Data**: get_instruments, get_order_book, ticker, etc.
- **Trading**: buy, sell, cancel, edit, get_open_orders, etc.
- **Account & Wallet**: get_account_summary, get_positions, etc.
- **Session Management**: enable/disable_cancel_on_disconnect

#### Files Modified/Created
- `lib/websockex_new/json_rpc.ex` - Core JSON-RPC functionality
- `lib/websockex_new/examples/deribit_adapter.ex` - Updated to use macros
- `test/websockex_new/json_rpc_test.exs` - Comprehensive tests
- `test/websockex_new/examples/deribit_json_rpc_test.exs` - Integration tests
- `docs/deribit/json_rpc_usage.md` - Usage patterns and workflows
- `.formatter.exs` - Updated for parentheses-free macro syntax

#### Completion Notes
- Implemented as 8th module (at project limit)
- Follows simplicity principles: 5 functions, each under 15 lines
- All 101 tests passing
- Ready for use by any JSON-RPC 2.0 WebSocket API
