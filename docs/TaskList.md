# WebsockexNew Task List

## Development Status Update (December 2024)
### ✅ Recently Completed
- **Phase 5 Complete**: Critical financial infrastructure tasks (WNX0019, WNX0020, WNX0023) moved to archive
- **Foundation + Enhancements**: 8 core modules + 3 critical infrastructure modules operational
- **Production Ready**: Financial-grade reliability with real API testing achieved

### 🚀 Next Up
All infrastructure tasks completed! WebsockexNew is production-ready.

### 📊 Progress: 0 active tasks - Project complete!

## WebSocket Client Architecture
WebsockexNew is a production-grade WebSocket client for financial trading systems. Built on Gun transport with 8 foundation modules for core functionality, now enhanced with critical financial infrastructure while maintaining strict quality constraints per module.

## Integration Test Setup Notes
- All tests use real WebSocket APIs (test.deribit.com)
- No mocks for WebSocket responses  
- Verify end-to-end functionality across component boundaries
- Test behavior under realistic conditions (network latency, connection drops)

## Simplicity Guidelines for All Tasks
- Maximum 5 functions per module
- Maximum 15 lines per function
- No behaviors unless ≥3 concrete implementations exist
- Direct Gun API usage - no wrapper layers
- Functions over processes - GenServers only when essential
- Real API testing only - zero mocks
