# WebsockexNew Task List

## Development Status Update (December 2024)
### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- **Phase 5 Complete**: Critical financial infrastructure tasks (WNX0019, WNX0020, WNX0023) moved to archive
- **Foundation + Enhancements**: 8 core modules + 3 critical infrastructure modules operational
- **Production Ready**: Financial-grade reliability with real API testing achieved

### üöÄ Next Up
All infrastructure tasks completed! WebsockexNew is production-ready.

### üìä Progress: 0 active tasks - Project complete!

## WebSocket Client Architecture
WebsockexNew is a production-grade WebSocket client for financial trading systems. Built on Gun transport with 8 foundation modules for core functionality, now enhanced with critical financial infrastructure while maintaining strict quality constraints per module.

## Integration Test Setup Notes
- All tests use real WebSocket APIs (test.deribit.com)
- No mocks for WebSocket responses  
- Verify end-to-end functionality across component boundaries
- Test behavior under realistic conditions (network latency, connection drops)

## Simplicity Guidelines for All Tasks
- Maximum 5 functions per module
- Maximum 15 lines per function
- No behaviors unless ‚â•3 concrete implementations exist
- Direct Gun API usage - no wrapper layers
- Functions over processes - GenServers only when essential
- Real API testing only - zero mocks

**üìÅ Archive Reference**: Full specifications, implementation details, and architectural decisions for all completed tasks are maintained in [`docs/archive/completed_tasks.md`](docs/archive/completed_tasks.md). Foundation tasks (WNX0010-WNX0018) and recent infrastructure tasks (WNX0019, WNX0020, WNX0023) are documented there with complete technical details.

## Task Details

All completed tasks have been moved to the archive. See [üìÅ Archive](docs/archive/completed_tasks.md) for detailed task specifications, implementation notes, and architectural decisions.

## Implementation Notes
WebsockexNew provides production-grade WebSocket functionality for financial trading systems with emphasis on simplicity, reliability, and real-world testing. All implementations follow strict complexity budgets and proven patterns.

## Platform Integration Notes
Primary integration with Deribit cryptocurrency exchange platform providing authentication, heartbeat handling, order management, and market data subscriptions. Architecture supports additional platforms through helper module pattern.
