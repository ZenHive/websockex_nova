## Task Details

### WNX0021: Request/Response Correlation Manager (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
**Description**: Track and correlate WebSocket request/response pairs for reliable order management using Client's internal state-based correlation with configurable timeouts and response matching.

**Simplicity Progression Plan**:
1. Create ETS table mapping request_id -> {request, timeout}
2. Implement track_request/3 and match_response/2 functions
3. Add timeout detection with Process.send_after
4. Integrate with Client.send_message for automatic tracking

**Simplicity Principle**:
Without request correlation, you can't reliably know if orders succeeded or failed. Simple ETS table provides O(1) lookup performance for request/response matching without complex abstractions.

**Abstraction Evaluation**:
- **Challenge**: How to correlate requests with responses without complex state machines?
- **Minimal Solution**: ETS table with request_id as key, timeout cleanup
- **Justification**:
  1. Financial trading requires reliable order status tracking
  2. ETS provides O(1) performance for high-frequency trading
  3. Simple timeout mechanism prevents memory leaks

**Requirements**:
- Request ID tracking with configurable timeouts
- Response matching to original requests
- Timeout handling for pending requests
- Integration with existing JSON-RPC ID field

**ExUnit Test Requirements**:
- Test request tracking with immediate response matching
- Verify timeout handling for unmatched requests
- Test concurrent request correlation under load
- Verify ETS table cleanup on process termination

**Integration Test Scenarios**:
- Real Deribit order placement with response correlation
- Test timeout handling during network interruption
- Verify correlation during reconnection events
- Test high-frequency request correlation performance

**Typespec Requirements**:
- request_entry :: {request :: term(), timeout_ref :: reference()}
- track_request(request_id :: binary(), request :: term(), timeout :: pos_integer())
- match_response(request_id :: binary(), response :: term())

**TypeSpec Documentation**:
- Document request tracking lifecycle
- Specify timeout behavior and cleanup
- Document integration patterns with Client

**TypeSpec Verification**:
- Verify request_id is valid binary
- Check timeout is positive integer
- Validate response matching returns correct request data

**Error Handling**
**Core Principles**
- Pass raw errors
- Use {:ok, result} | {:error, reason}
- Let it crash
**Error Implementation**
- No wrapping
- Minimal rescue
- function/1 & /! versions
**Error Examples**
- Raw error passthrough
- Simple rescue case
- Supervisor handling
**GenServer Specifics**
- Handle_call/3 error pattern
- Terminate/2 proper usage
- Process linking considerations

**Code Quality KPIs**
- Lines of code: ~50 (ETS-based correlation implementation)
- Functions per module: 3
- Lines per function: 8
- Call depth: 1
- Cyclomatic complexity: Low (simple ETS operations)
- Test coverage: 100% with real API testing

**Dependencies**
- ets: Built-in Erlang table storage
- websockex_new: Core WebSocket client
- jason: JSON encoding/decoding

**Architecture Notes**
- ETS table provides O(1) lookup performance for request correlation
- Simple timeout mechanism with Process.send_after prevents memory leaks
- Integration with existing JSON-RPC ID field for seamless correlation
- No complex state machines, just request_id -> request mapping

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Review Rating**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented directly in Client module using existing `pending_requests` state
- ~30 lines of code added to handle_call for send_message correlation
- Leverages JSON-RPC ID field for automatic correlation
- No external dependencies or ETS tables needed - simpler than originally planned
- Automatic timeout handling with configurable `request_timeout` in Config
- Full test coverage with 9 real API tests against test.deribit.com

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Minimal complexity addition to existing Client
- ETS table lifecycle managed by request_tracker module
- Simple timeout mechanism with Process.send_after
- Clear separation from WebSocket transport concerns

**Maintenance Impact**:
- Enables reliable order management for financial trading
- Foundation for order status tracking and reconciliation
- Simple debugging with clear request/response trails
- No impact on existing WebSocket functionality

**Error Handling Implementation**:
- Request timeout: Return {:error, :timeout} and clean up entry
- Unknown response: Log warning, continue normal operation
- ETS operation failure: Let it crash, supervisor will restart

### WNX0022: Basic Rate Limiter
**Description**: Prevent API rate limit violations with simple token bucket algorithm implementation, configurable rate limits per connection, and automatic request queueing when limit reached.

**Simplicity Progression Plan**:
1. Implement token bucket algorithm with ETS state
2. Add configurable rate limits per connection
3. Implement request queueing when bucket empty
4. Integrate with Client for automatic rate limiting

**Simplicity Principle**:
Rate limiting prevents API bans that cause missed trading opportunities. Token bucket algorithm is simple, proven approach used across financial APIs without complex queue management.

**Abstraction Evaluation**:
- **Challenge**: How to prevent rate limit violations without complex scheduling?
- **Minimal Solution**: Token bucket with ETS state, simple queue
- **Justification**:
  1. Financial APIs have strict rate limits with severe penalties
  2. Token bucket algorithm is industry standard
  3. Simple queue prevents request dropping while maintaining order

**Requirements**:
- Configurable rate limits per connection
- Token bucket algorithm implementation
- Automatic request queueing when limit reached
- Integration with existing Client send operations

**ExUnit Test Requirements**:
- Test token bucket refill at configured intervals

- Token bucket state specification
- Queue management function types

**TypeSpec Documentation**:
- Document rate limiting configuration options
- Specify token bucket algorithm behavior
- Document queue processing and prioritization

**TypeSpec Verification**:
- Verify rate configuration has valid positive integers
- Check token bucket state maintains consistency
- Validate queue operations maintain request order

**Error Handling**
**Core Principles**
- Pass raw errors
- Use {:ok, result} | {:error, reason}
- Let it crash
**Error Implementation**
- No wrapping
- Minimal rescue
- function/1 & /! versions
**Error Examples**
- Raw error passthrough
- Simple rescue case
- Supervisor handling
**GenServer Specifics**
- Handle_call/3 error pattern
- Terminate/2 proper usage
- Process linking considerations

**Code Quality KPIs**
- Lines of code: ~75 (Token bucket implementation)
- Functions per module: 4
- Lines per function: 10
- Call depth: 1
- Cyclomatic complexity: Low (simple algorithm)
- Test coverage: 100% with real API testing

**Dependencies**
- ets: Built-in Erlang table storage
- websockex_new: Core WebSocket client

**Architecture Notes**
- Token bucket algorithm is industry standard for rate limiting
- ETS state provides concurrent access for high-frequency operations

### WNX0025: Eliminate Duplicate Reconnection Logic (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
**Description**: Eliminate architectural duplication where both Client (network-level) and Adapter (process-level) handle reconnection independently, creating redundant attempts and unclear ownership. Implement surgical fix using configuration flag to disable Client's internal reconnection when supervised by adapters.

**Simplicity Progression Plan**:
1. **Surgical Fix**: Add `reconnect_on_error: false` option to DeribitGenServerAdapter configuration
2. **Client Enhancement**: Ensure Client respects `reconnect_on_error: false` by stopping cleanly instead of reconnecting
3. **Clear Ownership**: Document pattern - supervised clients delegate reconnection, standalone clients handle internally
4. **Verification**: Test eliminates duplication while preserving all heartbeat functionality

**Simplicity Principle**:
Current architecture has duplicate reconnection mechanisms creating redundant attempts and unclear responsibility boundaries. Simple configuration flag eliminates duplication with clear ownership.

**Abstraction Evaluation**:
- **Challenge**: Two reconnection mechanisms handling overlapping scenarios (Client: network failures, Adapter: process crashes)
- **Minimal Solution**: `reconnect_on_error: false` flag for supervised usage
- **Justification**:
  1. **Zero Risk**: No changes to critical heartbeat functionality
  2. **Clear Intent**: `reconnect_on_error: false` explicitly communicates delegation
  3. **Surgical**: Changes only the duplication issue, preserves all other architecture
  4. **Explicit Ownership**: Supervised ‚Üí adapter handles, standalone ‚Üí client handles
</edits>

**Requirements**:
- DeribitGenServerAdapter sets `reconnect_on_error: false` when connecting
- Client stops cleanly on connection errors when `reconnect_on_error: false`
- Adapter handles ALL reconnection scenarios (network failures + process crashes)
- Zero changes to heartbeat functionality (preserve financial system stability)
- Backward compatibility: standalone Client usage unchanged
- Clear ownership: supervised ‚Üí adapter handles, standalone ‚Üí client handles

**ExUnit Test Requirements**:
- Test Client stops cleanly (no internal reconnection) when `reconnect_on_error: false`
- Verify adapter recreates Client on process death with state restoration
- Test standalone Client continues internal reconnection by default (unchanged behavior)
- Verify only ONE reconnection mechanism active in supervised mode
- Test heartbeat functionality continues working across adapter-managed reconnections

**Integration Test Scenarios**:
- **Supervised Mode**: Network failure ‚Üí Client stops ‚Üí Adapter recreates ‚Üí State restored
- **Process Crash**: Client dies ‚Üí Adapter monitors ‚Üí New Client created ‚Üí Auth/subscriptions restored
- **Standalone Mode**: Network failure ‚Üí Client reconnects internally (unchanged)
- **Heartbeat Continuity**: Verify heartbeats work across adapter-managed reconnections
- **No Duplication**: Confirm only adapter attempts reconnection in supervised mode

**Typespec Requirements**:
- client_options :: %{reconnect_on_error: boolean()}
- Configuration validation for reconnection options
- Adapter supervision configuration types

**TypeSpec Documentation**:
- Document reconnection configuration options
- Specify supervised vs standalone behavior
- Document adapter implementation requirements

**TypeSpec Verification**:
- Verify reconnect_on_error is boolean value
- Check adapter properly disables Client reconnection
- Validate configuration affects reconnection behavior

**Error Handling**
**Core Principles**
- Pass raw errors
- Use {:ok, result} | {:error, reason}
- Let it crash
**Error Implementation**
- No wrapping
- Minimal rescue
- function/1 & /! versions
**Error Examples**
- Raw error passthrough
- Simple rescue case
- Supervisor handling
**GenServer Specifics**
- Handle_call/3 error pattern
- Terminate/2 proper usage
- Process linking considerations

**Code Quality KPIs**
- Lines of code: ~25 (Configuration flag implementation)
- Functions per module: 2
- Lines per function: 5
- Call depth: 1
- Cyclomatic complexity: Very Low (boolean configuration)
- Test coverage: 100% with real API testing

**Dependencies**
- websockex_new: Core WebSocket client

**Architecture Notes**
- Simple boolean configuration flag eliminates reconnection duplication
- Clear ownership model: supervised ‚Üí adapter handles, standalone ‚Üí client handles
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing Client usage patterns
- Minimal change with maximum architectural clarity

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Review Rating**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Implementation Notes**:

**Step 1: Update DeribitGenServerAdapter**
```elixir
defp do_connect(state) do
  opts = [
    reconnect_on_error: false,  # NEW: Disable internal reconnection
    heartbeat_config: %{type: :deribit, interval: 30_000}
  ]
  
  case WebsockexNew.Client.connect(state.url, opts) do
    {:ok, client} ->
      ref = Process.monitor(client.server_pid)
      {:ok, %{state | client: client, monitor_ref: ref}}
  end
end
```

**Step 2: Client Behavior (likely already works)**
```elixir
defp handle_connection_error(state, reason) do
  if state.config.reconnect_on_error do
    # Internal reconnection (current behavior)
    {:noreply, new_state, {:continue, :reconnect}}
  else
    # Stop cleanly, let supervisor handle
    {:stop, reason, state}
  end
end
```

**Result**: Clear ownership - adapter handles ALL reconnection when supervising

**Complexity Assessment**:
- **Surgical Fix**: One line change in adapter (`reconnect_on_error: false`)
- **Zero Risk**: No changes to critical heartbeat/financial functionality
- **Clear Intent**: Configuration explicitly communicates delegation
- **Elimination**: Removes duplicate reconnection completely
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing standalone usage unchanged

**Maintenance Impact**:
- Eliminates confusion about reconnection responsibility
- Clear patterns for building new adapters
- Simplified debugging of connection issues
- Foundation for consistent adapter implementations

**Error Handling Implementation**:

**Architectural Benefits**:
- **Eliminates Race Conditions**: Only one process attempts reconnection
- **Clear Debugging**: Connection issues have single point of failure
- **Simplified Monitoring**: Adapter owns complete lifecycle
- **Financial System Safety**: Zero risk to heartbeat functionality

**Pattern Documentation**:
```elixir
# For supervised clients (adapters)
Client.connect(url, reconnect_on_error: false)

# For standalone clients (unchanged)  
Client.connect(url, reconnect_on_error: true)  # default
```

**Before (Duplicate Reconnection)**:
```
Network failure ‚Üí Client attempts reconnection + Adapter attempts reconnection
Process crash   ‚Üí Adapter creates new Client ‚Üí New client has own reconnection
```

**After (Clean Ownership)**:
```
Network failure ‚Üí Client stops cleanly ‚Üí Adapter handles reconnection
Process crash   ‚Üí Adapter creates new Client ‚Üí Adapter controls reconnection
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement one-line change in DeribitGenServerAdapter
2. Test supervised vs standalone behavior
3. Document pattern for future adapter implementations
4. Consider making this the default when Process.monitor is detected
