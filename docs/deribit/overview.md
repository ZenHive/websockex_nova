# Deribit API Overview

Deribit provides three different interfaces to access the API:

- [JSON-RPC over Websocket](json_rpc.md)
- [JSON-RPC over HTTP](json_rpc.md)
- [FIX](fix_api.md) (Financial Information eXchange)

Deribit features a testing environment, `test.deribit.com`, which can be used to test the API. For this reason all examples in this documentation refer to that environment. To reach the production environment it should be changed to `www.deribit.com`. Note that both environments are separate, which means that they require separate accounts and credentials (API keys) to authenticate using private methods - test credentials do not work in production environment and vice versa.

To see the list of your API keys check **Account > API** tab, where you'll also find a link to API Console ( `>_ Api Console`) which allows you to test JSON-RPC API, both via HTTP and Websocket.

## Naming

Deribit tradeable assets or instruments use the following system of naming:

| Kind | Examples | Template | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Future | `BTC-25MAR23`, `BTC-5AUG23` | `BTC-DMMMYY` | `BTC` is currency, `DMMMYY` is expiration date, `D` stands for day of month (1 or 2 digits), `MMM` - month (3 first letters in English), `YY` stands for year. |
| Perpetual | `BTC-PERPETUAL` |  | Perpetual contract for currency `BTC`. |
| Option | `BTC-25MAR23-420-C`, `BTC-5AUG23-580-P` | `BTC-DMMMYY-STRIKE-K` | `STRIKE` is option strike price in USD. Template `K` is option kind: `C` for call options or `P` for put options. <br>**In Linear Options `d` is used as a decimal point for decimal strikes.**<br>**Example:** For `XRP_USDC-30JUN23-0d625-C` strike is 0.625. |
